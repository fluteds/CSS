# Tumblr

I'm slowly migrating my themes from Pastebin to here.
<br>This contains a range of themes from website themes to dashboard themes.

If you want to use these please read the following:

* I do not help with customizing any theme as I rarely use Tumblr now.
* If there is a technical issue please [leave an issue](https://github.com/fluteds/css/issues) on this repo.
